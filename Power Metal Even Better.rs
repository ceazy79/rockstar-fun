The fight is 'til the last breath
Let my wrath be "Death " 
My enemy is near
Knock my enemy down, down
The end is fear
Let my wrath be with my enemy

Pure Steel is mysterious
Glamouring Power is furious
My fate is fatal
The fighter says  Metal 
Let the path be him
Let my wrath be with " all but", him

SCREAM my wrath
